- 👋 Hi, I’m @bryanhjj! I'm a self-taught programmer.

- 👀 I’m interested in C# and C++, I hope that one day I'll be able to start a pet project of making a video game on my own.

- 🌱 I’m currently familiar with the following: C#, C++, Javascript, Python3, HTML, CSS, React, Node, SQL
 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects using the languages that I am familiar with so that I may gain some experience in this line of work as well as building my portfolio.

- 📫 Feel free to contact me via email:
